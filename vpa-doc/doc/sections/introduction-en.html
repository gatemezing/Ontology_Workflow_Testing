### Origin
  
The European Agency for Railways manages - through its obligations regarding Registers - large sets of data which document certain requests as present in the Safety and Interoperability Directives:

  - in OSS, vehicle authorisation evidence sets are submitted as mainly verified by NoBo's, DeBo's and other appropriate bodies. The end-result is the permission to place vehicle(type)s on the market.
  - in OSS as well, trackside projects' compliance with TSI evidence is submitted, allowing an approval of the project after revision of project requirement lists, by the Agency.
  - in ERADIS, this evidence of verification and conformity, expressed as certificates and declarations, is registered.
  - in ERATV, the vehicle(type) data and the delivered authorisation is then published for (re)use by relevant stakeholders.
  - in EVR, the vehicles are registered for operation, again reusing much of the same data as above.

However, a common and practical ontology for these permission-based processes was not yet available. Also, other stakeholders in the railway sector, like National Safety Authorities or Registering Entities, could be helped by the restructuring of their data as per new ontology. This would allow interoperable exchange of data across the sector. Through the mentioned Directives and as an example, the Agency also wishes to support the data streams linked to the safety certification and authorisation processes as executed by the NSA's.
  
To that end, the verified permissions ontology must be seen as allowing data to be registered as it appears in the following two consecutive, generalised processes:

  1. a *verification process* in which evidence, regarding compliance to a section of some requirements, is verified by an `appropriate body`, in order to allow it to be submitted to a `permitting body`.
  2. the process by which this `permitting body` converts the request and the submitted evidence into a *permission*, enabling the `requesting body` to execute a certain step/process.

The name `verified permissions` tries to collect this pair of activities.

### Roles

  In general, three bodies (legal entities or in some cases individual persons) execute core roles in the VP supported processes:

  1. Requesting body who needs a permission from a permitting body, based on a submitted request, of which part at least is made of verified evidence.
  2. Permitting body granting the permission after consultation of the submitted request, and especially the completeness and details regarding the evidence submitted
  3. Appropriate body consolidating the evidence needed by the requesting body to be accepted by the permitting body.

### Concepts

  The ontology captures the following details, each with certain exclusions nevertheless:

  - A `Request` can be filed using at least one `Case`, each with its precise and specific `Scope`. 
  - A `Scope` must be seen as the concrete and specific topic of the `Permission`, for which separate evidence is needed as documented in `DocumentedEvidence`. 
  - Certain evidence can be linked to the whole `Request` as it cannot be linked specifically to a `Case` (and its `Scope`).
  - `DocumentedEvidence` must not be seen as the evidence documentation itself, but as the outcome of processes executed by the Appropriate Body.
  - In order to detail which requirements' sections were effectively checked, the ontology provides the `Compliance` class.

### Assumptions and elements out of scope

  > [!WARNING]
  > The following assumptions are for information only, and all legal requirements prevail. They are given only with the intention to clarify the correct use of this ontology.
  
  This ontology does NOT define:
  - what exactly a Requirement, as closed by DocumentedEvidence, must look like. The Agency uses IRI's to legal requirements to express these requirements, and uses `vp:section` to enumerate the paragraphs for which compliance is normally checked. It will regroup these sections in a SKOS Concept Scheme.
  - what a Restriction must look like, apart from the fact that (1) it MUST be considered together with the Evidence, in order to close a requirement and (2) it is ONLY formulated by the appropriate body. The Agency has observed that in most cases text suffices to express it.
  - what the verifiable sections within requirements exactly contain (as it assumes a controlled vocabulary to do so), but it enables to declare these sections applicable and even (non-)compliant as registered in the documented evidence. The Agency is using the sections within the TSI's (themselves Requirements) to model how Vehicle Types have been assessed according to data in ERATV.
  
  A requesting body submits the evidence as it sees fit, and the permitting body must always decide on its completeness. The ontology on purpose does not foresee a property expressing completeness.

  Most verification processes assume the following:
  
  - All scopes must be covered or the permission cannot be granted, unless the scope is reduced by the Appropriate Body.
  - The evidence, as present in `DocumentedEvidence`, must close all required `Requirements` or the `Permission` cannot be granted.
  - Data regarding evidence can only be accepted if the link with the requirement (and eventual restriction) is present.
  
  It is well possible to link the VP ontology to a business case, in which the exact sections to close within a Requirement:
  - can minimally be proposed by the requesting body
  - can maximally be defined by the permitting body
  but this is out of scope of the VP ontology. 
  
  The legislation mostly provides for the sections to verify in a Requirement, and both stakeholders should find agreement in the range of the compliance check, in line with the legislation.
