<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Verified Permissions ontology serves data collection for processes leading to a permission :

- The delivery - by a permitting body to a requesting body - of a `Permission`, required by some legislative framework to execute a certain (e.g. safety-related) operational process or to commence the next step in a larger process;
- The submission of `Evidence` - verified by an appropriate body - in order to support the claim that the requesting body is able to execute said process or commence said step.
- The registration of this approprite body's verification activity and results, as Compliance to sections of Requirements in scope, eventually accompanied by Restrictions.

Three bodies appear as such, each with its dedicated role:

  1. The requesting body asking for a permission to execute the mentioned process;
  2. The permitting body authorised to grant such a permission;
  3. the appropriate (mostly accredited) body allowed to verify all claims regarding the evidence submitted in the scope of the mentioned process.

The ontology serves as a basis for subClasses as used in the following processes at the EU Agency for Railways:

  1. Vehicle (type) Authorization: in which an Applicant requests the Authorising Entity for the Authorization for Placing on the Market of a vehicle (type), based on evidence provided by NoBo's and other assessment bodies;
  2. Vehicle Registration: in which a Vehicle Keeper requests the Registering Entity for the Registration for operation on networks, based on evidence related to maintenance and said authorization;
  3. Trackside Approval: in which an Infrastructure Manager asks the Agency for the Approval of a trackside project;

However, the following processes were also analysed and should be supported by this ontology:

  4. Safety Certificate: in which a (new/existing) Railway Undertaking asks for the (re)certification of its SMS in order to be allowed the roles and functions of a RU;
  5. Safety Authorisation: in which a (new/existing) Infrastructure Manager asks for the (re)authorisation of its SMS in order to allowed the roles and functions of an IM.

More generally, the ontology should allow for non-railway related processes as well:

  6. Accreditation of a Body by an accreditation body
  7. Delivery of a topical permissions, for instance by administrations (example: building permits, environmental permits, etc).
  8. Delivery of licenses, whereby a strong link exists with [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/).

The two first examples will be illustrated in the chapter Use Cases and classes/properties will be foreseen to drive these processes.
