<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Verified Permissions ontology serves data collection in permission-based processes:

- The delivery - by a permitting body to a requesting body - of a `Permission`, required by some legislative framework to execute a certain (e.g. safety-related) operational process;
- The submission of evidence - verified by an appropriate body - in order to support the claim that the requesting body is able to execute said process.

Three bodies appear as such, each with its dedicated role:
  1. The requesting body asking for a permission to execute the mentioned process;
  2. The permitting body authorised to grant such a permission;
  3. the appropriate (mostly accredited) body allowed to verify all claims regarding the evidence submitted in the scope of the mentioned process.
