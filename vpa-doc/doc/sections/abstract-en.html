<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Verified Permissions ontology serves data collection in permission-based processes:

- The delivery - by a permitting body to a requesting body - of a `Permission`, required by some legislative framework to execute a certain (e.g. safety-related) operational process;
- The submission of evidence - verified by an appropriate body - in order to support the claim that the requesting body is able to execute said process.

Three bodies appear as such, each with its dedicated role:
  1. The requesting body asking for a permission to execute the mentioned process;
  2. The permitting body authorised to grant such a permission;
  3. the appropriate (mostly accredited) body allowed to verify all claims regarding the evidence submitted in the scope of the mentioned process.

The ontology serves as a basis for subClasses as used in the following processes at the EU Agency for Railways:
  1. Vehicle (type) Authorization: in which an Applicant requests the Authorization for Placing on the Market of a vehicle (type), based on evidence provided by NoBo's and other assessment bodies;
  2. Vehicle Registration: in which a Vehicle Keeper requests the Registration for operation on networks to the Registering Entity, based on evidence related to maintenance and authorization;
  3. Trackside Approval: in which an Infrastructure Manager asks for the Approval of a trackside project;

However, the following processes were also analysed and should be supported by this ontology:
  4. Safety Certificate: in which a (new/existing) Railway Undertaking asks for the (re)certification of its SMS in order to be allowed the roles and functions of a RU;
  5. Safety Authorisation: in which a (new/existing) Infrastructure Manager asks for the (re)authorisation of its SMS in order to allowed the roles and functions of an IM.

The two first examples will be illustrated in the chapter Use Cases.
